# Benign keratosis

"Benign keratosis" is a generic class that includes seborrheic keratoses ("senile wart"), solar lentigo - which
can be regarded a flat variant of seborrheic keratosis - and lichen-planus like keratoses (LPLK), which
corresponds to a seborrheic keratosis or a solar lentigo with inflammation and regression.

The three subgroups may look different dermatoscopically, but we grouped them together because they are similar
biologically and often reported under the same generic term histopathologically. From a dermatoscopic
view, lichen planus-like keratoses are especially challenging because they can show morphologic features
mimicking melanoma and are often biopsied or excisedfor diagnostic reasons. The dermatoscopic appearance of seborrheic keratoses varies according to anatomic site and type.

## You probably should not worry about your condition but asking your doctor about it is always a good idea.
