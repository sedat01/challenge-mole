# Actinic Keratoses

Actinic Keratoses (Solar Keratoses) and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (Bowen's disease) are common noninvasive, variants of squamous cell carcinoma that can be treated locally without surgery. Some authors
regard them as precursors of squamous cell carcinomas and not as actual carcinomas. There is, however,
agreement that these lesions may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma â€“ which is usually not
pigmented. Both neoplasms commonly show surface scaling and commonly are devoid of pigment.

Actinic keratoses are more common on the face and Bowen's disease is more common on other body
sites. Because both types are induced by UV-light the surrounding skin is usually typified by severe sun
damaged except in cases of Bowen's disease that are caused by human papilloma virus infection and not
by UV. Pigmented variants exist for Bowen's disease and for actinic keratoses, and both are included
in this set.

## If your result is Actinic Keratoses it can be treated without surgery, keep calm and see a doctor. Your condition is probably not serious.
