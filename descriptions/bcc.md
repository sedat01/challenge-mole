# Basal cell carcinoma

Basal cell carcinoma is a common variant of epithelial skin cancer that rarely metastasizes but grows
destructively if untreated. It appears in different morphologic variants (flat, nodular, pigmented, cystic),
which are described in more detail by Lallas, A. et al. The dermatoscopic universe of basal cell carcinoma. Dermatol Pract Concept 4, 11â€“24 (2014).
