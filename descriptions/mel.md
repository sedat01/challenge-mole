# Melanoma

Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants. If
excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical excision. Melanomas can be invasive or non-invasive (in situ).
Melanomas are usually, albeit not always, chaotic, and some melanoma specific criteria depend on anatomic site.

You should contact your doctor as soon as possible. Melanoma is black skin cancer.
