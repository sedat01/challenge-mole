Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes and appear in a myriad of variants, which all are
included in our series. The variants may differ significantly from a dermatoscopic point of view. In
contrast to melanoma they are usually symmetric with regard to the distribution of color and structure.

## Those are benign formations and carry no risk to your health.
